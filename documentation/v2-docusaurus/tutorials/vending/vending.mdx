## System

In this tutorial, we model a **vending machine** as a bigraphical reactive system.
The machine has two main parts:

- **Front-end panel** — accepts user input, such as selecting a drink or inserting coins.
- **Brewer/dispensing unit** — processes the order, prepares the drink, and delivers it to the user.

The model captures both the **structural configuration** (panel, brewer, inventory, coins) and the **reactive behaviour** (coin insertion, drink selection, brewing, dispensing).

By the end of this tutorial, you will see how to:

- Specify the machine’s controls and initial configuration
- Encode each user action and machine response as a reaction rule
- Simulate the system to explore possible interaction sequences
- Adopt an analysis-driven, object-oriented approach with bigraphs

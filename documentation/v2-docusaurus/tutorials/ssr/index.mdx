This tutorial models and simulates a **Self‑Sorting Robots (SSR)** system in the Bigraph Framework.

<br/>

We’ll build a grid, place three robots, define synchronization and movement rules, then run a BFS model check to explore all behaviors until the robots are sorted by ID.

You will also see how the compositional nature of bigraphs helps to generalize this for *n* robots and not only three.

**What you’ll learn**
- Combine environment and agent components into one bigraph
- Encode synchronization with locks (`SLck`, `SLckRef`)
- Drive motion using movement tokens and waypoints
- Explore behaviors via reaction graphs

Discover what **Bigraph Framework** is all about and learn the core concepts behind it.

## Creating a Bigraph

At the moment, Bigraph Framework supports only _pure bigraphs_ and _kind bigraphs_.

### Signature
To create a bigraph, a so-called **signature** must be created first.
Technically, it defines the **syntax** of a bigraph and determines what **types** (i.e., _controls_ of a bigraphs) we can create in the following.

To create a signature, we begin by spawning a _signature builder_ that is internally provided by a _pure factory_.
All further operations will use the same factory in the current _execution context_.
The first step is to create a signature builder by using the appropriate factory method.
Here, `BigraphFactory#pureSignatureBuilder()`:

:::tip
Note that all examples use a static import of the `BigraphFactory` class' operations:
```java
import static org.bigraphs.framework.core.factory.BigraphFactory.*;
```
This makes access to its operations more convenient.
:::

<CodeBlock className="language-java">{getting_started_guide_0}</CodeBlock>

As mentioned above, the signature specifies the syntax of a bigraph we are going to create in the following.
The resulting signature contains two controls: a _User_ with an arity of 1, and a _Computer_ with an arity of 2.
The arity specifies how many _connections_ a control can have.
The semantic meaning of the term "connection" is left open here - it can represent anything, for example, an ethernet link or an association relationship between elements.

:::tip
A more compact form for creating controls is the following:
```java
signatureBuilder.addControl("User", 1, ControlStatus.ATOMIC)
```
The control is instantly added to the signature.
Contrary, using `#newControl()` returns a control instance that can be used for other purposes.

### Bigraph Builder

Now we are able to instantiate a pure bigraph builder instance.
It allows us to build our bigraph by adding child nodes and connections among them.
The signature above determines which kind of nodes we can add to the bigraph (our syntax).
Therefore, we have to supply the previously created signature to the `pureBuilder()` method.

<CodeBlock className="language-java">{getting_started_guide_1}</CodeBlock>

The example shows how to add two nodes ("User" and "Computer") under the same root (we do it twice) and how to link all to the same _outer name_ with the label "login". The bigraph is illustrated below.

:::info
Note that the method `addChild` will throw an `InvalidConnectionException`
if the node cannot be connected to the outer name (because of its arity specified by the
signature).

## Elementary Bigraphs

Let us now examine how more trivial bigraphs can be created which are
termed _elementary bigraphs_. Essentially, there are two categories:
Placings and Linkings. They do not contain any node, thus, they are node-free
bigraphs.

:::info
Elementary bigraphs are essential building blocks in the theory and fundamental to define the normal form of bigraphs.
:::

Elementary bigraphs allow to build more complex bigraphs easily.
We show how to create a concrete placing and linking, before we use them
for composition later in the next section.

:::info
Even if elementary bigraphs usually do not take a signature, it must be provided.
This is due to technical reasons with respect to the bigraphical metamodel that is used internally.
Refer to the project [Bigraph Metamodel](https://git-st.inf.tu-dresden.de/bigraphs/ecore-bigraph-meta-model) for more details.

:::

<!--Note on equality: Object equality at the instance level is not to be compared-->
<!--with mathematical equality of bigraphs. This is also know as bigraph isomorphism problem.-->

The next code example shows how we can create a so-called _merge<sub>n</sub>_ (i.e., a placing where
_n_ sites are located under one root) and an _identity link graph_ (i.e., inner and outer
interfaces of the link graph are connected), which can also be regarded as a bijective substitution in bigraph-jargon.

<CodeBlock className="language-java">{getting_started_guide_2}</CodeBlock>

The factory provides the method `#purePlacings()` to create a placings builder.
With it we create a _merge_, a _join_, or a _barren_ to mention a few.
By passing the integer 2 as argument, a merge with two sites is created.
Further, we create an identity link graph with the name "login".

The two elementary bigraphs merge and identity are depicted below.

|---|---|
| ![basic-merge-bigraph](../assets/basics/basic-merge-bigraph.png) | ![basic-identity-bigraph](../assets/basics/basic-identity-bigraph.png)  |

</center>

## Composition of Bigraphs

Bigraphs may be composed by using special operators. This allows us to
modularize bigraphs by constructing sub-structures separately from each other
and compose them later to build a larger bigraph.

To equip a bigraph with operators we simply pass it to the static method
`#ops()` provided by the `BigraphFactory` class.

<CodeBlock className="language-java">{getting_started_guide_3}</CodeBlock>

The code above describes a composition that merges the two roots of the previously created `bigraph`
under one root node with index 0 and under one root indexed 1.
At the same time we keep the links so that all nodes are kept connected via the link graph.

:::info
Note that composition may throw the following two exceptions `IncompatibleSignatureException` and `IncompatibleInterfaceException`
if the signatures are not the same or the interfaces are not compatible.
[//]: # (See [Theory]&#40;./advanced/theory&#41; to get more details about how bigraphical composition works.)
Some operators are explained in [Composition](composition).
For a full account consult [JavaDoc of the `BigraphComposite` interface](https://bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/apidocs/de/tudresden/inf/st/bigraphs/core/BigraphComposite.html).
:::

![composed-bigraph](../assets/basics/composed.png)

:::tip
As seen before, bigraphs can be constructed by an _operator_ approach (composition and product).
Note that the bigraph builder also supports the creation of hierarchies that can be later combined to build a larger bigraph
easily.
Example:
```java
PureBigraphBuilder<DefaultDynamicSignature>.Hierarchy h1 = pureBuilder(sig).hierarchy("A");
pureBuilder(sig).createRoot().addChild(h1);
```
Hierarchies can separately created and extended.
Finally, they can be added as a child node as usually at any point in the bigraph.

Linkings between nodes within different hierarchies shall be established using inner or outer names.

on how to create signatures, bigraphs, elementary bigraphs and how to compose them to

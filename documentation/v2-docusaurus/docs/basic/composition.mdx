Composition allows to build larger bigraphs easily by means of their
categorical operators _tensor product_ and _composition_.

The tensor product allows the place two bigraphs side-by-side. Composition
on the other hand may place one bigraph under another.

By using these operations, one may specify several bigraphs individually from each other
before creating a more complex one. This concept enables a form of modularization
when modeling bigraphs.

<!-- ### List of Methods -->
<!-- <AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS> -->

## Composition

### `BigraphComposite#compose(Bigraph<S> inner)`

Places the inner bigraph `f` inter to the outer bigraph.

### `BigraphComposite#compose(BigraphComposite<S> inner)`

Places the inner bigraph composite `f` inter to the outer bigraph.

## Parallel Product

### `juxtapose(Bigraph<S> f)`
Places the inner bigraph `f` next to the outer bigraph. Link names must
be distinct.

### `juxtapose(BigraphComposite<S> f)`
Places the inner bigraph composite `f` next to the outer bigraph. Link names must
be distinct.

### `parallelProduct(Bigraph<S> f)`
Places the inner bigraph `f` next to each other with link sharing.

### `parallelProduct(BigraphComposite<S> f)`
Places the inner bigraph composite `f` next to each other with link sharing.

### `parallelProductOf(Bigraph<S>... bigraphs)`
Convenient method do put several bigraphs next to each other with link sharing.

### `juxtpositionOf(Bigraph<S>... bigraphs)`
Convenient method do put several bigraphs next to each other with link sharing.

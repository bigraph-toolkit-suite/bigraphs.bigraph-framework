A Complete Guide to the Bigraph Framework.

Latest Version: 0.9.5-SNAPSHOT

> **Notice:** The API is subject to change. Use at your own risk.

## What is Bigraph Framework

**Bigraph Framework** is a software framework for the creation and simulation of bigraphs
to expedite the experimental evaluation of the bigraph theory in real-world applications.

The goal of this framework is to facilitate the implementation of context-aware, agent-based systems or cyber-physical systems, for example.
The high level API eases the programming of bigraphical systems for various real-world application.
The framework is developed around a _metamodel-first approach_, when working with bigraphical structures.
It provides several means towards model-driven software development for integrating the bigraph theory into software.

### Overview of the Features

- Dynamic creation of bigraphs at runtime, which are based on the Ecore metamodel
- Visualization of bigraphs (beta)
- Bigraph Matching
- Bigraphical Reactive Systems: Simulation of bigraphs by reaction rules and synthesisation of a labelled transition system
- Read and write meta and instance models to the file system (Ecore/XMI)
- Conversion of bigraphs into other file formats (e.g., GraphML, BigMC or BigraphER)
<!-- - Model transformation (WIP) -->

### What are Bigraphs?

**Bigraphs** are an emerging graph theory and meta-model for global ubiquitous systems,
mobile computing, context-aware systems and the Internet of Things (IoT).
The theory is a unifying framework for many process calculi, including the ambient calculus, action calculi, Petri nets, 
the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and Ï€-calculus.

## Requirements

- Java
- Maven or Gradle


## Use / Install / Dependency Settings

Bigraph Framework is online available as a Maven dependency.

Artifacts are deployed to [ST-Artifactory](https://stgroup.jfrog.io/).

> #### Building from Source
> Otherwise, to build the source by yourself, follow the
> [README.md](https://git-st.inf.tu-dresden.de/bigraphs/bigraph-framework/blob/master/README.md)
> inside the repository.

### Empty Project Skeleton

To get started using Bigraph Framework right away, download the Maven-based Project Skeleton

- [Empty Project Skeleton for using Bigraph Framework](https://www.bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/download/empty-project-skeleton-bigraphframework.zip)

The README contained therein, describes how to compile and start an application.

Alternatively, follow the step-by-step project setup as described in the following.

### Packages

Depending on the build management tool you are using, one of the following
configuration for Maven or Gradle is necessary.

import * as myConstClass from "../src/components/BigraphDependencyBlock";
import * as myConstClass2 from "../src/components/BigraphRepositoryBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven" default>
    Add this inside the <code>dependencies</code> section of your project's <code>*.pom</code> file.
    Replace VERSION with the latest version.
    <pre>
    {myConstClass.MAVEN_DEP_CODE}
    </pre>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">
    Append this in your <code>build.gradle</code> file.
    Replace VERSION with the latest version.
    <pre>{myConstClass.GRADLE_DEP_CODE}</pre>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manually" label="Manually">
    not recommended
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Repository Setup

In order to resolve the dependencies above, the following custom repository
must be added as well. We provide the configuration for Maven and Gradle below.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven" default>
    The following Maven repository entry must be added to the <code>repositories</code> element of a <code>pom.xml</code> for a new project.
    <pre>
    {myConstClass2.MAVEN_REP_CODE}
    </pre>
    <br/>
    Another option is to modify the <code>settings.xml</code>, usually found in <code>~/.m2/</code>.
    <pre>
    {myConstClass2.MAVEN_REP_CODE2}
    </pre>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">
    For Gradle, add this to the project's build gradle file:
    <pre>{myConstClass2.GRADLE_REP_CODE}</pre>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Logging Configuration

Bigraph Framework employs SLF4J as a facade for the log4j logging framework.

Depending on your project setup, you may need to include the following libraries in your `pom.xml` :

```xml
<!-- When used within a Spring project -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
        </dependency>

<!-- For a bare Maven project -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
            <version>1.7.30</version>
        </dependency>
```

The example above shows how to use log4j2 in your project as the underlying logging framework.

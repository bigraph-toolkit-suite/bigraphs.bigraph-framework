## What is Bigraph Framework?

Bigraph Framework is a Java framework designed for developers and researchers for building, simulating, and analyzing reactive systems (e.g., cyber-physical, context-aware, agent-based, or distributed systems, IoT environments, ...).

It lets you model dynamic systems with both structure (who is inside what) and connectivity (who is connected and interacting to whom), and then simulate, visualize, and verify how those systems evolve over time.

Under the hood, the framework is based on Milner’s theory of Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS).

The high level API eases the programming of bigraphical systems for various applications.
The framework is developed around a [metamodel-first approach](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-ecore-metamodel), when working with bigraphical structures.

### Features

**Bigraph Modeling and Persistence**
- Create and manipulate bigraphs dynamically at **design time and runtime** using the **Bigraph Ecore Metamodel (BEM)**
([bigraphs.bigraph-ecore-metamodel](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-ecore-metamodel))
- Load and store both **bigraph metamodels** and **instance models** in standard file formats (Ecore/XMI)

**Visualization and Inspection**
- Export bigraphs and transition systems to standard graph formats:
**GraphViz (DOT), PNG, VCG (yComp)**
- Interactive, programmatic visualization via **GraphStream** for exploring structures

**Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS)**

Model and analyze system dynamics using **reaction rules** and **graph rewriting**:

- Pattern matching and rewriting powered by **jLibBig**, with full **node and link tracking**
- Specialized **link-graph (hypergraph) matching**
- Multiple **simulation and model-checking strategies**:
    - Breadth-first search (BFS)
    - Depth-first search (DFS)
    - Random exploration
    - Match-all / Match-first
    - Custom (Simulated Annealing, ...)
- Automatic construction of **Labeled Transition Systems (LTS)**
- **State predicates and logical connectors** for property checking
- **Rule priorities** to control nondeterminism and execution order
- **Tracking rules** to preserve identity of entities across reactions
- **Conditional rules** for guarded rewriting

**Import, Export, and Tool Interoperability**
- Export bigraphs and LTSs to standard graph formats: **DOT, GraphML, GXL, VCG**
- Interoperate with other bigraph tools: **BigMC, BigraphER, BigRed, jLibBig**, and others

**Attributed Bigraphs**
- Attach **arbitrary attributes** to:
    - Nodes
    - Links (edges and outer names)
- Attributes are **preserved during rewriting**, enabling data-rich CPS and agent-based models
(via tracking maps)


## Usage and Installation

Bigraph Framework is online available as Maven/Gradle dependency.

Artifacts are deployed to the _Central Repository_.

:::tip Building from Source
To build the source by yourself, follow the [README.md](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-framework/blob/main/README.md) inside the code repository.
:::

**Usage and Development Requirements:**

- Java >=21
- Maven v3.8.7 or Gradle

### Quick Start: Project Template

To get started using Bigraph Framework right away, download the Maven/Gradle-based Project Template:

- See <a href={`https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/Project-Skeleton-for-Bigraph-Framework`}>here</a> for the latest version on GitHub
- [Starter Project Template using Bigraph Framework](https://www.bigraphs.org/software/bigraph-framework/download/Project-Skeleton-for-Bigraph-Framework.zip) (ZIP-Archive)

The README contained therein, describes how to compile and start an application.

### Project Dependencies

Depending on the build management tool you are using, one of the following
configuration for Maven or Gradle is necessary.

import * as myConstClass from "../src/components/BigraphDependencyBlock";
import * as myConstClass2 from "../src/components/BigraphRepositoryBlock";

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven" default>
        Add this inside the <code>dependencies</code> section of your project's <code>*.pom</code> file.
        Replace VERSION with the latest version.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <pre>
        {myConstClass.MAVEN_DEP_CODE}
        </pre>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">
        Append this in your <code>build.gradle</code> file.
        Replace VERSION with the latest version.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <pre>{myConstClass.GRADLE_DEP_CODE}</pre>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="manually" label="Manually">
        Manual setup is not recommended.
        Refer to the <a href={"https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-framework/blob/main/README.md"}>README.md</a> in Bigraph Framework's code repository on how to build the framework from source.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Logging Configuration

Bigraph Framework employs SLF4J as a facade for the many logging frameworks.

Depending on your project setup, you may need to include the following libraries in your `pom.xml`/`build.gradle`.

For a bare Maven/Gradle project:
```xml
<!-- For example, use log4j-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.30</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Or, use a no-operation (NOP) logger implementation -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-nop</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.7</version>
</dependency>

<!-- or, for example, the reload4j implementation (fork of log4j) -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-reload4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.9</version>
</dependency>
```

For Spring-based Projects:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Not including these dependencies will result in warnings.
The example above shows how to use a NOP logger or a reload4j as the underlying logging framework in your project.

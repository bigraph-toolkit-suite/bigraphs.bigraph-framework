## What is Bigraph Framework?

Bigraph Framework is a Java framework designed for developers and researchers for building, simulating, and analyzing reactive systems (e.g., cyber-physical, context-aware, agent-based, or distributed systems, IoT environments, ...).

It lets you model dynamic systems with both structure (who is inside what) and connectivity (who is connected and interacting to whom), and then simulate, visualize, and verify how those systems evolve over time.

Under the hood, the framework is based on Milner’s theory of Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS).

The high level API eases the programming of bigraphical systems for various applications.
The framework is developed around a [metamodel-first approach](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-ecore-metamodel), when working with bigraphical structures.

<details style={{ background: 'transparent' }}>
    <summary><strong>What are Bigraphs?</strong></summary>
    Bigraphs are a theory and metamodel for global ubiquitous systems,
    mobile computing, context-aware systems and the Internet of Things (IoT), or in general: for reactive systems.
    It is grounded on category theory and regarded as a unifying framework for many process calculi, including the ambient calculus, action calculi, Petri nets,
    the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and π-calculus.
    The theory provides an algebra and a graph rewriting mechanism to describe, study and analyze the dynamic behavior of reactive systems.

### Features

**Bigraph Modeling and Persistence**
- Create and manipulate bigraphs dynamically at design time and runtime using the _Bigraph Ecore Metamodel (BEM)_
([bigraphs.bigraph-ecore-metamodel](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-ecore-metamodel))
- Load and store both _bigraph metamodels_ and _instance models_ in standard file formats (Ecore/XMI)

**Visualization and Inspection**
- Export bigraphs and transition systems to standard graph formats:
_GraphViz (DOT), PNG, VCG (yComp)_
- Interactive, programmatic visualization via GraphStream for exploring structures

**Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS)**

Model and analyze system dynamics using _rules_ and _graph rewriting_:

- Multiple _simulation and model-checking strategies_:
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Random state exploration
- Match-all / Match-first
- Simulated Annealing
- Custom
- Automatic construction of _Labeled Transition Systems (LTS)_
- _State predicates and logical connectors_ for property checking
- Rules
- _Rule priorities_ to control nondeterminism and execution order
- _Tracking rules_ to preserve identity of entities across reactions
- _Conditional rules_ for guarded rewriting
- Pattern matching and rewriting powered by _jLibBig_
- Dedicated _link-graph (hypergraph) matching_

**Import, Export, and Tool Interoperability**
- Export bigraphs and LTSs to standard graph formats:
_DOT, GraphML, GXL, VCG_
- Interoperate with other bigraph tools:
_BigMC, BigraphER, BigRed, jLibBig_, and others

**Attributed Bigraphs**
- Attach _arbitrary attributes_ to: nodes and links (edges and outer names)
- Attributes are _preserved during rewriting_, enabling data-rich models (via tracking maps)


## Usage and Installation

Bigraph Framework is online available as Maven/Gradle dependency.

Artifacts are deployed to the _Central Repository_.

:::tip Building from Source
To build the source by yourself, follow the [README.md](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-framework/blob/main/README.md) inside the code repository.
:::

**Usage and Development Requirements:**

- Java >=21
- Maven v3.8.7 or Gradle

### Quick Start: Project Template

To get started using Bigraph Framework right away, download the Maven/Gradle-based Project Template:

- See <a href={`https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/Project-Skeleton-for-Bigraph-Framework`}>here</a> for the latest version on GitHub
- [Starter Project Template using Bigraph Framework](https://www.bigraphs.org/software/bigraph-framework/download/Project-Skeleton-for-Bigraph-Framework.zip) (ZIP-Archive)

The README contained therein, describes how to compile and start an application.

### Project Dependencies

Depending on the build management tool you are using, one of the following
configuration for Maven or Gradle is necessary.

import * as myConstClass from "../src/components/BigraphDependencyBlock";
import * as myConstClass2 from "../src/components/BigraphRepositoryBlock";

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven" default>
        Add this inside the <code>dependencies</code> section of your project's <code>*.pom</code> file.
        Replace VERSION with the latest version.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <pre>
        {myConstClass.MAVEN_DEP_CODE}
        </pre>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">
        Append this in your <code>build.gradle</code> file.
        Replace VERSION with the latest version.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <pre>{myConstClass.GRADLE_DEP_CODE}</pre>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="manually" label="Manually">
        Manual setup is not recommended.
        Refer to the <a href={"https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-framework/blob/main/README.md"}>README.md</a> in Bigraph Framework's code repository on how to build the framework from source.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Logging Configuration

Bigraph Framework employs SLF4J as a facade for the many logging frameworks.

Depending on your project setup, you may need to include the following libraries in your `pom.xml`/`build.gradle`.

For a bare Maven/Gradle project:
```xml
<!-- For example, use a no-operation (NOP) logger implementation -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-nop</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.17</version>
</dependency>

<!-- or, for example, the reload4j implementation (fork of log4j) -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-reload4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.17</version>
</dependency>
```

For Spring-based Projects:

Spring Boot uses Logback (`ch.qos.logback.classic`) as its default logging framework.
That is, Spring Boot's `spring-boot-starter`, `spring-boot-starter-web`, etc. pull in Logback by default via `spring-boot-starter-logging` dependency.
If you want to change to another framework you must exclude `spring-boot-starter-logging`.
For example, to use Log4j2's SLF4J provider:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

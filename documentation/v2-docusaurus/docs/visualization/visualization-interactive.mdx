Bigraph Framework provides an interactive Swing GUI display to view bigraphs.
This is achieved using the [GraphStream library](http://graphstream-project.org/).

The interactive visualization makes it possible to navigate through bigraphs and observe their structure.
This is superior to static graphic files.

## Usage Example


```java
import org.bigraphs.framework.core.impl.pure.PureBigraph;
import org.bigraphs.framework.visualization.*;
import org.graphstream.ui.view.Viewer;

PureBigraph bigraph = ...;
SwingGraphStreamer graphStreamer = new SwingGraphStreamer(bigraph)
                .renderSites(false)
                .renderRoots(false);
graphStreamer.prepareSystemEnvironment();
Viewer graphViewer = graphStreamer.getGraphViewer();
// keep the window open
while (true)
    Thread.sleep(100);
```

Calling `SwingGraphStreamer#prepareSystemEnvironment()` is important to instruct GraphStream which UI viewer to use.
Internally, the following properties are set:
```java
System.setProperty("java.awt.headless", "false");
System.setProperty("org.graphstream.ui", "swing");
```
See [here](https://graphstream-project.org/doc/Tutorials/Graph-Visualisation/) for more information on that.

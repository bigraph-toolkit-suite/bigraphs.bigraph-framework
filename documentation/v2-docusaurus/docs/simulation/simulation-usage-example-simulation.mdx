This guide provides a complete walkthrough on how to simulate bigraphical reactive systems (BRS).
The following aspects are covered:
- Specification of the signature
- Specification of the initial state
- Specification of the reaction rules

This is done along a running example.

**Scenario Description**
The running example describes a "system", where a user can put a fruit into a basket.
The environment of this "system" comprises a `Table`, a `Basket`, some generic `Fruit` entities and a `User`.
Only one high-level 1action exists, namely, picking a fruit and placing it into the available `Basket`.
This simple system description might sound simple but when more users and baskets are introduced the problem becomes more challenging to manage.
This type of problem involves concurrent behavior and dynamic allocation and arises from a category of challenging problems in the field of computer science.


In the following, we are going to translate this scenario description into a BRS-based specification and simulate its behavior.
That allows us to observe and look into the behavior of the system.

Bigraphs can be exported using the Visualization Module of Bigraph Framework.
See, for example, [Exporting Bigraphs as Images](../visualization/visualization-intro) on how to export a bigraph as PNG using the DOT format.

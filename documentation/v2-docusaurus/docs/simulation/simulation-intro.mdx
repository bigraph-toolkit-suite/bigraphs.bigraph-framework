In bigraphs, the dynamic behavior of a system is represented by means of _reaction
rules_ written ![reaction-relation-between-agents](../assets/simulation/eq/eqn-reaction-relation.svg), where ![reaction-relation-between-agents](../assets/simulation/eq/eqn-agent-vars.svg) are called _agents_ (in bigraph-jargon), and _R_ is a reaction rule.
Generally, an _agent_ is a bigraphical state of the system; a snapshot of the system at a specific point in time.

Given a signature, a set of reaction rules and an initial agent (all defined over the same signature), one can create a so-called **bigraphical reactive system** that acts like a container including all these components.
A BRS can be regarded as the specification of a system, process or model under consideration.

BRSs introduce a temporal notion to bigraphs and allows to perform and track changes of the system over time.

This page explains how to create BRSs.
Moreover, the structure of reaction rules and their different kinds are introduced.

## Bigraphical Reactive System (BRS)

A BRS is a model of a system specification containing an agent (i.e., the host graph, the initial state) and a collection of reaction rules.

:::info Mathematical Definition
In category theory, BRSs are defined as syntactical categories endowed with reaction rules.
Specifically, a concrete BRS is a s-category ![reaction-relation-between-agents](../assets/simulation/eq/eqn-brs-category.svg) containing a signature and a set of rules.
:::

All reactive system implementations extend the interface `org.bigraphs.framework.core.reactivesystem.ReactiveSystem<B extends Bigraph<? extends Signature<?>>>` of the Core Module in Bigraph Framework.

### By Instantiation

A reactive system for _pure bigraphs_ can be created by calling its constructor as follows:

```java
PureReactiveSystem reactiveSystem = new PureReactiveSystem();
```

Then, an agent and reaction rules can be added like this:
```java
// Set the initial agent
PureBigraph agent = ...;
reactiveSystem.setAgent(agent);
// Add a reaction rule
ReactionRule<PureBigraph> rr = ...;
reactiveSystem.addReactionRule(rr);
```

:::info Format of the Agent
In the bigraph theory, an _agent_ is any _ground bigraph_, i.e., a bigraph that has no sites and inner names.
It must also be prime, i.e., it must have only _one root_.
:::

:::note Exceptions
An exception will be thrown if the rules or agent are not in the correct format.
:::

:::note Some further remarks
- Predicates as used in [model checking](verification-intro) for reachability checking can be added using the method `PureReactiveSystem#addPredicate(ReactiveSystemPredicates<B> predicate)`.
- See also [here](simulation-predicates) on how to create predicates.
:::

### By Inheritance

Inheriting a reactive system implementation allows for an object-oriented approach to better organize and manage domain-specific BRSs in an application.

The following examples defines a BRS that can compute the sum of two integers, which are represented in bigraphs in [unary form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms).
In this form the symbol _S_ is used to denote successor, and _Z_ to mean zero.
For example, the number 2 would be writing as _S.S.Z_.

```java
public class AddExpr extends PureReactiveSystem {

    public AddExpr(int a, int b) throws Exception {
        setAgent(createAgent(a, b));
        addReactionRule(createReactionRule_1());
        addReactionRule(createReactionRule_2());
    }

    // Custom extended method of this reactive system specification that allows execution
    public PureBigraph execute() throws Exception {
        // Instantiate a matcher
        AbstractBigraphMatcher<PureBigraph> matcher = AbstractBigraphMatcher.create(PureBigraph.class);
        // Get the current state
        PureBigraph agentTmp = getAgent();

        // ...
        // apply rules according to some strategy or randomly
        // ...

        // Return the final state
        return agentTmp;
    }
}
```

The concrete methods `AddExpr#createAgent()`, `AddExpr#createReactionRule_1()` and `AddExpr#createReactionRule_2()` are omitted in this example for clarity.

:::tip More Details
Refer to the [Usage Example](usage-example-brs-simulation), which describes a complete procedure on how to practically use bigraph matching and rewriting in Bigraph Framework.
It introduces the basic functionality regarding matching and rewriting.

An overview of the most important classes is also listed on this page in section [Changing Bigraphs over Time: Overview](#changing-bigraphs-over-time-overview).

## Structure of Reaction Rules

BRS introduce a time-varying notion to bigraphs through _reaction rules_.
That is, reaction rules allow some kind of _simulation_, which internally is enabled by means of _graph rewriting_.
The bigraph rewriting formalism allows to synthesize a (potentially infinite) labelled transition system (LTS).
Each node of the LTS is a bigraph state.
States are connected by edges called _transition relations_ labeled with the reaction rule that led to this state.
The LTS can have cycles.

To generate an LTS, reaction rules must be applied.
A reaction rule comprises a _redex_ and _reactum_.
That is, a rule consists of a left-hand side, and a right-hand side.
The meaning of a rule is as follows:
The redex specifies the pre-conditions and the reactum the post-conditions.
If the redex could be found in some agent (i.e., host graph), the matched part of the agent is replaced by the reactum.
This is also called _graph rewriting_, which solves the subgraph matching problem.

![bigraph-reaction-rule-example](../assets/simulation/bigraph-rule-example-1.png)
*Example of a bigraphical reaction rule comprising a redex (left-hand side) and reactum (right-hand side), which both are bigraphs. The rule describes the movement of the smaller circle from one place to another place (larger circles).*

[//]: # (See [here]&#40;&#41; for more details regarding rule strategies.)



**Simulating a BRS works as follows:**
Beginning with an _agent_ (i.e., the initial bigraph state of the BRS), a set of reaction rules is applied as long
as a match can be found, or until some stopping criteria eventuates (such as time, number of states explored, any convergence criteria, etc.).
Note that the _agent_ and the _reaction rules_ need to be defined over the same _signature_.


:::info Non-Deterministic Rules
Sometimes a rule can have multiple occurrences in a host graph.
Thus, rules are often _non-deterministic_.
:::

:::tip Reaction Rules
Refer to section [Reaction Rules](simulation-reaction-rules), which explains bigraphical reaction rules in more detail.
:::

:::tip Rule Strategies
Bigraphical reaction rules enable a form of the more general rule-based programming paradigm.
Therefore, you can use advanced rule strategies to control the execution order of rules.

## Changing Bigraphs over Time: Overview

Having explained the essentials of BRSs until here, the _matching_ and _rewriting_ functionality from the following classes can be used to conveniently execute BRSs in arbitrary ways:

**Matching**

- [`org.bigraphs.framework.simulation.matching.AbstractBigraphMatcher<B extends Bigraph<? extends Signature<?>>>`](https://bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/apidocs/org/bigraphs/framework/simulation/matching/AbstractBigraphMatcher.html)
    - This abstract class defines a _matcher_ and needs a _host graph_ and _rule_ to perform bigraph matching.
    - A bigraph matcher consists of a bigraph matching engine w.r.t. to the bigraph type.
    - The correct one is automatically created using the factory method `#create(Class)` by supplying the bigraph class type.
    - Matches are returned via an iterator (the instances of the matches are of type [`BigraphMatch`](https://bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/apidocs/org/bigraphs/framework/core/reactivesystem/BigraphMatch.html)).

**Rewriting**
- [`org.bigraphs.framework.core.reactivesystem.ReactiveSystem`](https://bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/apidocs/org/bigraphs/framework/core/reactivesystem/ReactiveSystem.html)
    - This interface defines two methods for rewriting after a match was found:
        - [`ReactiveSystem#buildGroundReaction(final B agent, final BigraphMatch<B> match, final ReactionRule<B> rule)`](https://bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/apidocs/org/bigraphs/framework/core/reactivesystem/ReactiveSystem.html#buildGroundReaction(B,org.bigraphs.framework.core.reactivesystem.BigraphMatch,org.bigraphs.framework.core.reactivesystem.ReactionRule))
        - [`ReactiveSystem#buildParametricReaction(final B agent, final BigraphMatch<B> match, final ReactionRule<B> rule)`](https://bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/apidocs/org/bigraphs/framework/core/reactivesystem/ReactiveSystem.html#buildParametricReaction(B,org.bigraphs.framework.core.reactivesystem.BigraphMatch,org.bigraphs.framework.core.reactivesystem.ReactionRule))
    - Implementations of this interface:
        - Core Module: [`org.bigraphs.framework.core.reactivesystem.AbstractSimpleReactiveSystem`](https://bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/apidocs/org/bigraphs/framework/core/reactivesystem/AbstractSimpleReactiveSystem.html) is an abstract base class for all reactive systems in Bigraph Framework.
        - Simulation Module: [`org.bigraphs.framework.simulation.matching.pure.PureReactiveSystem`](https://bigraphs.org/products/bigraph-framework/apidocs/org/bigraphs/framework/simulation/matching/pure/PureReactiveSystem.html) (extends `AbstractSimpleReactiveSystem`) is a concrete implementation of a reactive system for the class of pure bigraphs.

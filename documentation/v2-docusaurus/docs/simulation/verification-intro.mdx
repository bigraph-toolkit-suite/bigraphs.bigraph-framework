In the area of software engineering, formal verification is an interesting subject.
*Verification* is a formal approach to prove the correctness of programs by means of mathematical models and techniques.

In this process, a *program is checked against* a set of
correctness properties, also called the *specification*.
A program is said to be *correct*, if the specification conforms to the implementation.

By proving specific properties of some software, this type of testing assists in developing safe and reliably software.
In fact, many bugs cannot be detected by traditional means such as unit tests.

One type of verification technique is the so-called **model checking**, which
is implemented in Bigraph Framework.

<!-- For model checking, we the following dependencies are used: -->
<!-- - tweety, JDD, JavaDD -->

## Creating a Model Checker

<!-- Two processes mutually requesting a exclusive resource. -->
<!-- Then, we want to verify that both processes never enter their critical section at the same time. -->
This code example shows how to create a model checker object for pure bigraphs:

```java
PureReactiveSystem reactiveSystem = new PureReactiveSystem();
// Add an agent and reaction rules

/* code omitted */

// create model checking options
ModelCheckingOptions opts = ModelCheckingOptions.create();

// Create the pure bigraph model checker
PureBigraphModelChecker modelChecker = new PureBigraphModelChecker(reactiveSystem,
            BigraphModelChecker.SimulationType.BREADTH_FIRST,
            opts);
modelChecker.execute();
```

Some remarks:
- The `execute()` method may throw a `BigraphSimulationException`
- Simulation types are covered [here](simulation#simulation-types).
- Model checking options are explained [here](simulation#additional-model-checking-options).

## Listeners

One may listen to specific events that are thrown during the simulation. This gives the user the possibility to interact
with the simulation and fire additional actions or to log these events and evaluate them later, additionally to the
final built reaction graph.

Therefore, the interface `ReactiveSystemListener<B extends Bigraph<? extends Signature<?>>>` must be implemented and added
to a model checker instance. It provides methods to listen when a reaction rule is applied or when the verification process finished, for instance.

For example, see [here](simulation-predicates#listen-to-predicate-evaluation) on how to listen for predicate evaluation results.





## Asynchronous Execution

To perform the model checking asynchronously, call the `BigraphModelChecker#executeAsync()`:

```java
Future<ReactionGraph<PureBigraph>> reactionGraphFuture = modelChecker.executeAsync();
ReactionGraph<PureBigraph> pureBigraphReactionGraph = reactionGraphFuture.get();
```

The `executeAsync()` method does not block the execution and returns a `Future` object to fetch the result later.
It contains the complete reaction graph of the simulated BRS.

One can then export the transition system by calling  `modelChecker.exportReactionGraph(pureBigraphReactionGraph)`.

## Provide a custom executor service

The `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` is used to submit tasks of the model checker.

Bigraph framework offers to provide a custom `ExecutorService` by implementing the interface
`de.tudresden.inf.st.bigraphs.core.providers.ExecutorServicePoolProvider`, found in the `bigraph-core` dependency.
The class `BigraphModelChecker` uses the `java.util.ServiceLoader` (see [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html#the-serviceloader-class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html#the-serviceloader-class)
to search for an implementation.

A default _executor service provider_ is provided within the `bigraph-rewriting` dependency which creates a fixed thread pool.

## Safety and Liveness Properties

As long as the transition system is being built from a BRS specification,
the provided predicates of the user are checked simultaneously for each
new computed state in the course of a BRS simulation.

> **Note:** A user can listen to these events. Therefore, the interface `ReactiveSystemListener<B extends Bigraph<? extends Signature<?>>>` must be implemented and added to the model checker instance.

These predicates come in two forms: as safety properties or as liveness
properties. The former represents a state in the system that should not
occur, whereas the later denote a system state that eventually occurs.
By this we can test if a program never reaches a "bad state" (safety),
or correctly terminates (reaching a desirable state), possibly producing
a result (liveness).

Some further safety properties are: partial correctness, absence of deadlocks,
and mutual exclusion (see [\[1\]](#ref1)).

> **Note:** Fairness properties are important for reactive systems. Safety is easier to check then liveness.

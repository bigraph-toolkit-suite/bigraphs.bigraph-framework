### What is a Factory?

### Signature Builder

### Bigraph Builder

The builder only creates valid bigraph models in the sense that the underlying
Ecore model is well-formed according to the specification (see EMOF-based bigraph model).

If an external meta-model is loaded, the framework may check if the model
is valid.

[JLibbig](https://github.com/bigraphs/jlibbig) is a Java library for bigraphical reactive systems.
Bigraph Framework allows to encode its bigraph model into an object that JLibBig underlies.
See the following examples.

```java
JLibBigBigraphEncoder encoder = new JLibBigBigraphEncoder();
JLibBigBigraphDecoder decoder = new JLibBigBigraphDecoder();
PureBigraph big_00 = big_00();

it.uniud.mads.jlibbig.core.std.Bigraph encoded = encoder.encode(big_00);
System.out.println(encoded.toString());

PureBigraph decoded = decoder.decode(encoded);
BigraphFileModelManagement.Store.exportAsInstanceModel(decoded, System.out);
```

## Encoding a Bigraph to a Ranked Graph

In some cases, bigraphs may be casted to <strong>ranked graphs</strong>, as defined in [\[1\]](#ref1), by exploiting the proposed encoding approach described in [\[2\]](#ref2).

The next listing shows how to encode the bigraph depicted below to a ranked graph.

This bigraph is taken from [\[2\]](#ref2).

```java
PureBigraph bigraph = ...;
PureBigraphRankedGraphEncoding graphEncoding = new PureBigraphRankedGraphEncoding(bigraph);
graphEncoding.encode();
Graph<AbstractRankedGraph.LabeledNode, AbstractRankedGraph.LabeledEdge> graph = graphEncoding.getGraph();
```

Internally, an object of class `org.jgrapht.Graph<V, E>` is created because <a href="https://jgrapht.org/">JGraphT</a> is used to represent the structure of the ranked graph. The graph is an unweighted directed graph allowing multiple edges and refusing self-loops.

The encoded bigraph as ranked graph is illustrated below.

The graphical file is provided by the <i>visualization module</i> of this framework using the [`BigraphRankedGraphExporter`](../visualization/visualization-intro#visualizing-ranked-graphs).

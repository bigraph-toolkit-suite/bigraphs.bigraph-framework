## Exporting a `PureReactiveSystem`

The following example specifies a bigraphical actor-based system and shows how to convert it into BigraphER specification file format.
The system's specification follows the `*.big` model file presented [here](https://uog-bigraph.bitbucket.io/actors.html).

:::caution
When converting bigraph instance models into the `.big` model file (conforming to the BigraphER specification language),
some ambiguous cases may occur that require manual treatment.

For some instances, Bigraph Framework has no information whether to "finalize" the leaves of a hierarchy with a barren, i.e.,
using the expression "`.1`".
Bigraphs modelled within Bigraph Framework do not need this information, as the bigraph itself is represented as a graphical structure
and not an algebraic expression as it is the case with the BigraphER specification language.

To circumvent this problem, algorithm attaches "`.1`" automatically to every control that is not atomic and has no sites
specified.
Vice versa, if a site is required under a node, it must be explicitly modelled within Bigraph Framework as it
cannot be inferred automatically.
This applies to all bigraph and predicate variable expression of the BigraphER specification language.
For rule declarations, we do not follow this strategy, i.e., the expression "`.1`" is not attached at all.
Therefore, instantiation map shall be used or manual edits.
:::

The signature:

<CodeBlock className="language-java">{createSig0}</CodeBlock>

Next, we need to specify the agent:
<CodeBlock className="language-java">{bigrapherTest01_0}</CodeBlock>

Then, followed by the rules:

<CodeBlock className="language-java">{bigrapherTest01_1}</CodeBlock>

Note how we attach a label to the rules. This allows the converter later to use these labels as new variable names for the `*.big` model file


The predicate:

<CodeBlock className="language-java">{bigrapherTest01_2}</CodeBlock>

Now, since everything is defined, we need to create a reactive system and add the agent, rules, and the predicate:
<CodeBlock className="language-java">{bigrapherTest01_3}</CodeBlock>

The transformator will produce the output as shown below:

```text
ctrl A = 1;
ctrl A' = 1;
ctrl Mail = 0;
atomic ctrl M = 2;
ctrl Snd = 0;
ctrl Ready = 0;
ctrl New = 0;
ctrl Fun = 0;

react snd = (A{a0}.Snd.( M{a1, v} | id(1) ) | Mail) --> (A{a0} | Mail.( id(1) | M{a1, v} ));
react ready = (A{a}.Ready | Mail.( M{a, v} | id(1) )) --> (A{a} | Mail) | {v};
react lambda = (A{a}.Fun) --> (A{a});
react new = (A{a0}.( id(1) | New.( id(1) | A'{a1}.id(1) ) )) --> (A{a1}.( id(1) | id(1) ) | A{a0}.( id(1) | id(1) )) @ [1, 2, 0, 2];

big bigraphbasemodel = Mail.1 | A{b}.Snd.M{a, v_b} | A{a}.Snd.( M{a, v_a} | Ready.Fun.1 ) ;

big phi = Mail.( M{a, v} | id(1) );

begin brs
	init bigraphbasemodel;
	rules = [{snd,ready,lambda,new}];
	preds = {phi};
end
```

The user can verify that the output, or more specifically the behaviour of the system, resembles the one provided [here](https://uog-bigraph.bitbucket.io/actors.html):

```bash
$ bigrapher full -v -s ./states -t trans.svg -f svg,json -M 20 actors.big
```

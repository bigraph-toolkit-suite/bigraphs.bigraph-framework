<!--# Getting Started-->

Discover what Bigraph Framework is all about and learn the core concepts behind it.

## Basic Tutorial

### What is a Factory?

### Signature Builder

### Bigraph Builder

The builder only creates valid bigraph models in the sense that the underlying
Ecore model is well-formed according to the specification (see EMOF-based bigraph model).

If an external meta-model is loaded, the framework may check if the model
is valid.

### Create Elementary Bigraphs

Note on equality: Object equality at the instance level is not to be compared with mathematical equality of bigraphs.
This is also know as bigraph isomorphism problem.

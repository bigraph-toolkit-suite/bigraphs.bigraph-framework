title: Converting Bigraphs

<!--# Converting Bigraphs-->

A bigraph model may be converted to and from several different formats,
including GraphML, [BigMC](http://bigraph.org/bigmc/), [GXL](http://www.gupro.de/GXL/) and
[BigraphER](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~michele/bigrapher.html).

Therefore, the module dependency `bigraph-converter` contains the corresponding
encoders/pretty printers etc.

## Conversions to other bigraph tools

The following bigraph tools are supported by now:
{@inject: supportedConversions}

The encoding follows the same prinicpal schema. The specific implementation of the interface `ReactiveSystemPrettyPrinter`
has to be instantiated. The generated output can be printed to the console or redirected to an output stream:
<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

### `String toString(R system)`

Returns the result of a reactive system encoding as string.

### `void toOutputStream(R system, OutputStream outputStream)`

Redirects the result of an encoding to an output stream.



> Note that the existing bigraph tools vary in their feature set.
> That means that not all properties specified in Bigraph Framework may be directly translated to the language supported by each tool.

### BigMC

```java
// specify some reactive system
PureReactiveSystem reactiveSystem = ...;

BigMcTransformator prettyPrinter = new BigMcTransformator();
String bigmcEncoding = prettyPrinter.toString(reactiveSystem);
System.out.println(bigmcEncoding);

FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(new File("bigmc.bgm"));
prettyPrinter.toOutputStream(reactiveSystem, fout);
fout.close();
```

### BigraphER

```java
// specify some reactive system
PureReactiveSystem reactiveSystem = ...;

BigrapherTransformator prettyPrinter = new BigrapherTransformator();
String bigrapherEncoding = prettyPrinter.toString(reactiveSystem);
System.out.println(bigrapherEncoding);

FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(new File("bigrapher.big"));
prettyPrinter.toOutputStream(reactiveSystem, fout);
fout.close();
```

title: Creating Complex Bigraphs
---

In this section we are going to explain how to construct more complex bigraphs
easily.
We are doing so by using elementary bigraphs or separately building substructures
and combining them later.

Some techniques are presented in the following and may serve as best
practices when modeling bigraphs using Bigraph Framework.

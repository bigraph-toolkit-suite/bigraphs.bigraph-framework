# Converting Bigraphs

A bigraph model may be converted to and from several different formats,
including GraphML, [BigMC](http://bigraph.org/bigmc/), [GXL](http://www.gupro.de/GXL/) and
[BigraphER](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~michele/bigrapher.html).

Therefore, the module dependency `bigraph-converter` contains the corresponding
encoders/pretty printers etc.
